# Mechatronics
Mechatronics integrates mechanics, electronics, controls, and computing to create streamlined, cost-effective, and dependable systems. Unlike traditional product development, which typically begins with mechanical design, followed by electrical and control system design in sequence, the mechatronic design aims to leverage interdisciplinary collaborations from the outset.
